This project is for digitising BTO bird surveys, like individual breeding bird surveys.

The form when you add a record allows you to set:

  

* Species (By BTO code, but it lists the species name)

* Species sex - male, female, pair, or unknown

* If it is in song

* If it is calling

* If it is flying (and the direction, handy little spin wheel to choose the direction, it's not precise, so you may need to play with it)

* Abundance

* Date

  

And then in the metadata, there various other things recorded:

* BoCC5 status

* Whether it is a Section 41 species

* If it is a UKBAP priority species

* Whether it is Annex 1 of the birds directive

* Whether it is Schedule 1 species

  

* Any further comments

* And an auto-filling box of author, and the created/updated dates for data record keeping.
